# Empire Command & Control
Empire is a powerful post-exploitation and adversary emulation framework designed to aid Red Teams and Penetration Testers.
Built with flexibility and modularity in mind, Empire enables security professionals to conduct sophisticated operations with ease.

The Empire server is written in Python 3, providing a robust and extensible backend for managing compromised systems.
Operators can interact with the server using Starkiller, a graphical user interface (GUI) that enhances usability and management.
